# LoteriaMexicanaMultiplayer

This project was developed for the course of Advanced Object Oriented Programming. The goal was to develope
a version of the Mexican Lottery Game applying OOP concepts and using sockets to implement the communication
between the server and the players. The code and classes are [here](https://github.com/angelicaf13/LoteriaMexicanaMultiplayer/tree/master/src/loteriamexicanamultiplayer).
